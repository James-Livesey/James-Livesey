### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm James!
Welcome to my GitHub profile! You can find out more about me on [my website](https://jamesl.me). I'm a passionate 18-year-old coder and have a big interest in what technology can do to change the world.

I work on _loooads_ of projects, and I'm very active on GitHub. Take a look at all of my featured projects â”€ they're the ones that I'm especially proud about! ðŸ˜„

If you're looking to work with me, you'll probably want to agree with [my coding style](https://github.com/James-Livesey/James-Livesey/blob/main/codestyle.md) â”€ it makes the code in all of my projects look neat and tidy.

If you want to contact me, the easiest way is to [DM me on Glipo](https://glipo.net/u/James) or any other social media network I use (or in fact have founded). If you're being serious, maybe send me an email: james@liveg.tech
