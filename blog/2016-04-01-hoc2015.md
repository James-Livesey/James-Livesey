# An Hour Of Code At The Apple Store
_Archive_

I went to the Apple Store as part as an Hour Of Code. I used an iPad to play on a web game about Star Wars and coding. Since I am a whiz at coding, I managed to complete it in 40 minutes, which the staff said was an extremely short amount of time to code. My mum had a little go (not an hour) at coding. I received a certificate from the Apple Store saying that I successfully achieved an Hour Of Code.
