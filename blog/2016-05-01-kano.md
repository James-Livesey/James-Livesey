# Our Trip To Kano HQ, London
_Archive_

## How We Got There
Harry and I managed to get into a competition in our home city, Norwich, called SyncTheCity. It is an event for adults, but we managed to get a place. SyncTheCity was a competition where you had to create a start-up business in 54 hours. We came runners-up and we both received a Kano computer and a trip to Kano HQ. Harryâ€™s brother Finlay came to the HQ too.

## The HQ
The HQ consists of 2 rooms, an office and a room where the workshop and kitchen is. The kitchen room also has another room in it called the meeting room and is made out of some spare Kano boxes. The office is open plan, and it contains marketeers, people whose lives depend on numbers (Finance people!), software engineers, customer services people and the two leaders! Unfortunately, the leaders were away. The HQ is the only Kano office, and is located behind a restaurant. They also have a ping-pong table, even though they have a ping-pong app on the Kano operating system!

## The End Of The Day
At the end of the day, Harry, Finlay and I were given a T-shirt, a badge, four secrets (securely packaged!) and the first edition of the Kano Club Magazine. We then went to the science museum and caught the Tube and Train home.

Thanks to the DPD delivery man for telling us directions to get to the HQ!
