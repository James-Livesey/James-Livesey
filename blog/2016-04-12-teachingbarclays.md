# Teaching Kids To Code At Barclays
_Archive_

I recently was invited to Norwich City stadium where Barclays were teaching kids to code. I was helping and I did one of the hardest challenges in the booklet, which I found quite easy because of my experience. I taught a young girl around the age of eight to code for the very first time, which was wonderful. I did have a nice time with the lovely staff and we got on really well. Thanks Barclays!
