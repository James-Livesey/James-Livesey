I recently finished my brand new PC build setup which I have been working on after many months of getting good deals on eBay. Now that I have a more powerful computer than my Pixelbook I carry around with me, I am finally able to do more resource intensive activities such as NLE video editing and CAD/3D object rendering, and I may finally start gaming too!

Here's some more photos of my build:
