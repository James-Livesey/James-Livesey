# A Day With DroidScript
_Archive_

Recently I went to the Eagle Lab in Cambridge to play around with something called DroidScript and we were taught how to make a cool rock-dodging Game on Android. On the day, I met the founders, David Hurren and Sarah Hide.

If you don’t know what DroidScript is about, it’s the new way to simplify software development for the next generation of coders. And it’s very cool! It is sort of an API for HTML or JavaScript so kids can code their own Android apps (and publish them to Google Play, if they have $99). In fact, the SDK app has over 500,000 downloads! Now that’s a lot. I wish I had an app that successful!
