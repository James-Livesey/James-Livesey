# A Trip To Whitespace
_Archive_

As part of coming runners-up in the SyncTheCity competition, me and my friends Harry and Finlay were invited by John Fagan, who is one of the organisers of SyncTheCity, to a tech business hub named Whitespace. We received our Kano computers, which were part of our SyncTheCity prizes. Whitespace has some very interesting businesses in it, and is very modern.
