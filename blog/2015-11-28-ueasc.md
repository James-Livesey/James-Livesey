# UEA Scratch Competition 2015

What a good day it was!

Before the competition, we had to make an adventure game using the popular childrenâ€™s programming language, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). Our adventure game was called [_Frozen Time_](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/67585384/)*.

'Frozen Time' unfortunately did not win this section of the competition. Even though it had a lot of code! Luckily, there was a section of the competition called the 'Unseen Task'. And the task was to make a calculator. My friend Hugo and I, actually made a scientific calculator in just 30 minutes. [(Click here to see it!)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/67586088/) When it came down to judgement time, we won! Our prize was a Tesco Hudl 2, and we gained lots of recognition.

*The game is not about Disney's Frozen film!
