# Hello, world!
Hello, welcome to my new website! I will hope to update this blog regularly so that you can see what I have been doing in terms of code, competitions and more. You may have seen me from my other site, but I have decided to start fresh with a site that I actually have coded myself. Enjoy!

**Edit:** I'm going to be importing some of my old blog articles into this new site, hence the fact that there's blog articles here that are older than this 'Hello, world!' post.
