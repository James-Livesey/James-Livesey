My friend Harry and I have recently participated in a competition where you have to create a tech start-up company in just 54 hours. At first, we had to present a 1 minute pitch to an audience, and then other people would join our team. Our team made a Christmas wish list website called SoxSuk. We then had to present a presentation to an audience of roughly 200-300 people.
