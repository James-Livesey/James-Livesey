# Eagle Labs Is Open!
_Archive_

Today marks the day that Eagle Labs in Whitespace, Norwich is open! The Eagle Lab is a 'Makerspace'*. I have been waiting for this for a long time, and I am sure that many techie children of Norwich will agree. After all, Norwich is a new tech city!

On the night, there were many demonstrations, including laser cutting coasters and 3D-Printing various objects. I also got involved by teaching many kids at the event to code the BBC micro:bit, the entry-level device that will enable kids to code. It is being handed out to every Year 7 student at school in the UK, free of charge. I taught children of my age and adults on how to make a flashing face appear on a micro:bit, and they loved it! As the opening night drew to a close, I just wanted to stay because it was so good!
